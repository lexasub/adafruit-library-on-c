<b>What is it?</b></br>
It's library for led matrix from adafruit library.</br>
<b>For what device it'is?</b></br>
For avr controllers</br>
<b>Why not original?</b></br>
minuses of original library:</br>
for arduino,</br>
writed with classes. </br>
it's bad effecienty for avr controllers.</br>
I'm tried rewrite it, but for my atmega8 giant size for code.</br>
May be exists people, when help me do faster & do smaller this code.</br>
