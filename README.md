<b>What is it?</b>
It's library for led matrix from adafruit library.
<b>For what device it'is?</b>
For avr controllers
<b>Why not original?</b>
minuses of original library:
for arduino,
writed with classes. 
it's bad effecienty for avr controllers.
I'm tried rewrite it, but for my atmega8 giant size for code.
May be exists people, when help me do faster & do smaller this code
